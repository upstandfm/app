            <ContentSubHeader>What does asynchronous mean?</ContentSubHeader>

            <p>
              Synchronous communication usually refers to a "face-to-face"
              exchange of information. Like having a meeting with people that
              are all present in the same room, or doing a conference call.
              <br />
              Everyone is (supposed to be) actively listening while the meeting
              takes place. And when someone asks you a question, you'll
              (usually) respond immediately, as part of the conversation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Asynchronous communication usually refers to communication that
              happens over time. Like sending and receiving emails, or chat
              messages.
              <br />
              Here, a response doesn&apos;t have to (and isn&apos;t expected
              to!) be immediate.
            </p>

            <ContentSubHeader>What&apos;s a standup?</ContentSubHeader>

            <p>
              It&apos;s a common ritual among agile/scrum teams. Usually every
              day all team members will gather in person, and each person will
              answer 3 questions:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>What did you work on yesterday?</li>
              <li>What will you work on today?</li>
              <li>Do you have any impediments?</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              After each team member answers these questions&mdash;usually
              referred to as "the update"&mdash;work will resume (in theory{' '}
              <span
                role="img"
                aria-label="grinning face with aquinting eyes and sweat drop"
              >
                ðŸ˜…
              </span>
              ).
            </p>

            <ContentSubHeader>Why are standups useful?</ContentSubHeader>

            <p>
              When executed correctly, standups make the team aware of what
              everyone is working on, and what they might be struggling with.
            </p>

            <p>
              In general, standups improve the flow of information. They help
              participants with getting a deeper understanding of the problem
              space they are working in. They also stimulate everyone to help
              each other, and share/synchronize their understanding of shared
              goals.
            </p>

            <p>
              Effectively, they contribute to a stimulating work environment.
            </p>

            <ContentSubHeader>What&apos;s the problem then?</ContentSubHeader>

            <p>
              Well, a fixed time must be picked for the entire team to be
              available. This is especially difficult for distributed teams that
              work remotely (usually due to timezone differences).
            </p>

            <p>
              Additionally, the actual time the standup takes place can
              interfere with people&apos;s schedule, or disrupt someone&apos;s
              workflow&mdash;due to context switching and "deep work"
              interference. This problem tends to be more prominent in a remote
              working environment, where people have different rhythms&mdash;due
              to personal preference and/or timezone difference.
            </p>

            <p>Other issues are:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Discussions during the standup are common (sidebar!), making the
                meeting less efficient.
              </li>

              <li>
                Participants can "zone out", get distracted or loose interest
                (especially if the standup takes a long time).
              </li>

              <li>
                There&apos;s no efficient way to "replay" the standup&mdash;in
                case someone couldn&apos;t attend, or when an "indirect" team
                member (like a manager) would like to be kept in the loop.
              </li>

              <li>There&apos;s usually no record of previous standups.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              What if team members could easily share- and listen to standup
              updates, whenever they want?
            </p>

            <ContentSubHeader>How?</ContentSubHeader>

            <p>Stay tuned for updates!</p>
